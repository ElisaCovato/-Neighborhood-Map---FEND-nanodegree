# Neighborhood App 

This project has been created as part of the Udacity FEND nanodegree. The aim of the project was to create a single page application feauturing a map of a favourite neighborhood, in my case I have chosen Rome's city center. 
 The project is mainly based on the use of  React to build the application, and the implementation of third-aprty APIs.

## App functionalities
The app feautures the city centr of Rome. Some markers are already in the map to identify popular monuments in Rome. A search function is present to easily discover these monuments, together with a list view. When clicking on a location or a marker, the user gets additional information (name, photo and brief extract)  taken from Wikipedia.
